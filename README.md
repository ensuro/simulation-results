# Simulations

The `meta` directory holds the metadata for the available results.

Each metadata file points to a file in `results` that has the actual results.

All files are JSON for better portability and less coupling with the simulator component.

Once the results are here they can be visualized in the `simulator-frontend` at https://simulator.ensuro.co/
